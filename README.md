# üöÄ JavaScript Bootcamp Practice  

This repository contains my **daily practice files** while learning JavaScript from the very basics to advanced topics.  
I am documenting everything here as part of my self-learning journey so that others can also follow along and learn.

## üìú About JavaScript  

JavaScript was created in **1995 by Brendan Eich** at Netscape. Initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, it became **JavaScript** to align with Java‚Äôs popularity at that time ‚Äî but JavaScript and Java are completely different languages.  

Originally built to make web pages interactive, JavaScript has now become one of the **most widely used programming languages**.  
Today, it powers not only web browsers but also servers, desktop apps, mobile apps, IoT devices and more (thanks to Node.js, React, Angular, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è What This Repository Covers (So Far)  

Below are the topics I‚Äôve covered up to now:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Hello World**  
- My first JavaScript program and basic script execution.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Datatypes**  
- Understanding primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`.  
- Non-primitive types like `object`, arrays, and functions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Variables**  
- `var`, `let`, `const` declarations.  
- Scope, hoisting, and best practices for using variables.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **JavaScript Execution**  
- How the browser executes JavaScript.  
- The call stack and execution context.  
- The role of the JavaScript engine.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Alert, Confirm & Prompt**  
- Using built-in browser dialogs for user interaction.  
- `alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()` and their real-life use cases.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Strings: Methods & Properties**  
- String properties like `length`.  
- Common methods like `charAt()`, `split()`, `slice()`, `substring()`, `replace()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`.  
- Template literals for easier string formatting.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Math in JavaScript**  
- Using the `Math` object.  
- Common methods like `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.random()`.  
- Real-life scenarios (calculations, random number generation).

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Truthy and Falsy Values**  
- How JavaScript evaluates conditions.  
- Lists of truthy and falsy values.  
- Common pitfalls when writing conditions.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Comparison Operators** (Current Topic)  
- Understanding equality and relational comparisons.  
- `==` vs `===` (loose vs strict equality).  
- `!=` vs `!==`.  
- Relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.  
- Real-life scenarios:
  - Validating user input.
  - Checking login credentials.
  - Conditional rendering in web pages.

# üîπ Logical Operators in JavaScript

This folder contains examples and explanations of **logical operators** in JavaScript.  
Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean values (`true` or `false`) and control the flow of decision-making in programs.

## üîπ Introduction

Logical operators are used in conditional statements to make decisions based on multiple conditions.  
In JavaScript, the **three main logical operators** are:

- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

## üîπ Logical Operators

| Operator | Name           | Description                                   |
|----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND    | Returns `true` if **both** operands are true  |
| `||`     | Logical OR     | Returns `true` if **any one** operand is true |
| `!`      | Logical NOT    | Inverts the boolean value                    |

---

## üîπ Truth Table

### Logical AND (`&&`)
| A (true/false) | B (true/false) | A && B |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| true          | true          | true   |
| true          | false         | false  |
| false         | true          | false  |
| false         | false         | false  |

### Logical OR (`||`)
| A | B | A \|\| B |
|---|---|---------|
| true  | true  | true  |
| true  | false | true  |
| false | true  | true  |
| false | false | false |

### Logical NOT (`!`)
| A | !A  |
|---|-----|
| true  | false |
| false | true  |

## üîπ Examples

### Example 1: Logical AND
```javascript
let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;

if (age > 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive.");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot drive.");
}

## üìö Why This Repo Exists  

I am learning JavaScript step by step. By uploading my daily practice:
- I can track my progress.
- Others can see real-world examples of learning from scratch.
- It builds a public portfolio showing my consistency.

## üöÄ Next Steps  

Future topics I plan to add:
- Functions & Scope
- Objects & Prototypes
- DOM Manipulation
- Events
- ES6+ Features
- Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- And more‚Ä¶
